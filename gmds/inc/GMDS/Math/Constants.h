 * The GMDS library is a computer program whose purpose is to provide a set of
 * functionnalities to represent and handle any type of meshes (2D, 3D,
 * triangles, tetrahedra, quad, hexa, polygons, polyhedra, etc.) and write
 * meshing algorithms. So it gathers many mathematical objects like points,
 * segment, quaternions, etc. and basic algorithms useful to build more evolved
 * ones.
