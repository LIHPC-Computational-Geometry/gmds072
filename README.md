# gmds072

![spack-ci](https://github.com/LIHPC-Computational-Geometry/gmds072/actions/workflows/spack-ci.yml/badge.svg)

Deprecated version of the [gmds](https://github.com/LIHPC-Computational-Geometry/gmds) project still in used in mgx. It will be soon replaced by the current gmds project.

This project is part of the [mgx](https://github.com/LIHPC-Computational-Geometry/mgx) ecosystem and conforms to its [CI policy](https://github.com/LIHPC-Computational-Geometry/spack_recipes#ci-and-versioning-policy-of-mgx-ecosystem-projects).

Spack CI has been copied (not reused) due to the Spack recipe name which is gmds (and not gmds072).
