# gmds072

Deprecated version of the [gmds](https://github.com/LIHPC-Computational-Geometry/gmds) project still in used in mgx. It will be soon replaced by the current gmds project.

This project is a dependency of the [mgx](https://github.com/LIHPC-Computational-Geometry/mgx) product.

Its Spack and Cmake CIs are based on reusable workflows provided in [lihpccg-ci](https://github.com/LIHPC-Computational-Geometry/lihpccg-ci) project.

Spack CI has been copied (not reused) due to the Spack recipe name which is gmds (and not gmds072).
